                        To help fight coronavirus, we must be responsible and stay at home.

                Most of the world's governments have appealed to their people to be responsible 
                and collaborate in the fight against coronavirus by staying at home in an effort 
                to mitigate its spread. Some countries have done this with legislative measures, 
                others with recommendations that encourage civic duty. Either way, all around the 
                world, people are confined to their homes.

                we must get used to a new way of living with our families and the activities we do at home. 
                Does sustainability have a place? Clearly it does. In this presentation, we remind you of 
                some simple tips for isolating yourselves at home against coronavirus while living sustainably.
